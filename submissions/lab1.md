- Network exposure: 127.0.0.1 only? [X] Yes [ ] No
- Container restart policy: default `no`

### Health Check

- API check (first 200 chars of `/api/Products`):
  ```
  {"status":"success","data":[{"id":1,"name":"Apple Juice (1000ml)","description":"The all-time classic.","price":1.99,"deluxePrice":0.99,"image":"apple_juice.jpg","createdAt":"2026-06-12T10:50:09.594Z", ...
  ```

  ```
  NAMES        STATUS          PORTS
  juice-shop   Up 29 minutes   127.0.0.1:3000->3000/tcp
  ```

### Initial Surface Snapshot (from browser exploration)
- Login/Registration visible: [X] Yes [ ] No — notes: Login and registration are available from the Account menu in the top-right area.
- Product listing/search present: [X] Yes [ ] No — notes: The homepage shows a product catalog with multiple juice shop items and a search field.
- Admin or account area discoverable: [ ] Yes [X] No — notes: Account menu is visible, but no admin area was directly visible before login.
- Client-side errors in DevTools console: [ ] Yes [X] No — notes: No runtime errors were observed in the Console. DevTools Issues showed form/accessibility warnings such as missing form field labels or autocomplete attributes, plus one browser cookie/navigation warning.
- Pre-populated local storage / cookies: `loglevel: DEBUG` was present in local storage. Cookies included `cookieconsent_status=dismiss`, `language=en`, and `welcomebanner_status=dismiss`; no authentication token was present before login.

### Security Headers (Quick Look)
Run: `curl -I http://127.0.0.1:3000 2>&1 | head -20`. Paste output:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Feature-Policy: payment 'self'
X-Recruiting: /#/jobs
Accept-Ranges: bytes

```
Which of these are MISSING? (cross-reference Lecture 1 OWASP Top 10:2025 — A06)
- [X] `Content-Security-Policy`
- [X] `Strict-Transport-Security`
- [ ] `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- [ ] `X-Frame-Options`

### Top 3 Risks Observed (2-3 sentences each, in your own words)
1. **Missing Content Security Policy** — The response does not include a `Content-Security-Policy` header, so the browser has fewer restrictions on where scripts and other resources may load from. This increases the impact of possible XSS issues and maps to OWASP Top 10:2025 A06 Security Misconfiguration.

2. **Missing HSTS** — The response does not include `Strict-Transport-Security`, so a production deployment over HTTPS would not instruct browsers to force secure connections. This is acceptable for a local HTTP lab, but would be a security misconfiguration in production, mapping to A06 Security Misconfiguration.

3. **Public unauthenticated API surface** — Product and review endpoints are visible from browser network traffic and can be queried without logging in. Public product data may be expected, but exposed APIs should be reviewed carefully for broken access control and excessive data exposure; this maps to A01 Broken Access Control.
